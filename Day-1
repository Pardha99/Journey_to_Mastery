Today, I began a fascinating exploration into the world of Linear Algebra!

I kicked things off by delving into the well-known 3𝒃𝒍𝒖𝒆1𝒃𝒓𝒐𝒘𝒏 channel, 

where I covered :

🔍 Vectors

  •   Linear Combinations, Span, and Basis Vectors

  •   Linear Transformations and Matrices

✖️ Matrix Multiplication as Composition

  •  Three-Dimensional Linear Transformation

  •  The Determinant

  •  Inverse Matrices, Column Space, and Null Space

📐   Nonsquare Matrices as Transformation Between Dimensions



Although it's only the first day, I already feel like I've embarked on a crazy adventure  🎢🤯



🐍📖Python:

After the Maths , I transitioned into Python, skimming through W3schools tutorials and  reading the official Python documentation at python.org/doc.
