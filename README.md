🤖 Journey to Mastery: 300 Days of AI and ML 🚀 #300DaysOfAIandML

Hey LinkedIn community,

As the AI legend Andrew Ng wisely said, "Make a habit of learning." Inspired by this and following Andrew Karpathy's advice of 10,000 hours of deliberate work for mastering a field, and his insights from the Lex Fridman's podcast, I've set my sights on a 300-day journey to attain a professional level in AI and ML in 2024.

`Why 300 days?` Well, it's a challenge I'm eager to take on. In a year with 366 days, I plan to dedicate 300 days to focused learning, reserving the remaining 66 for a well-deserved break (Out of the 66 days, I've already utilized 9 days remaining, leaving me with 55 days).

My goal for the year: `1000 hours of learning`. That translates to approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes each day. To manage this, I'll split it into two slots of 100 minutes each, making the journey more manageable without overwhelming myself.

As someone very interested in AI but unfamiliar with its inner workings, I'll be learning whatever I can in this flow. 🤓💻 Starting with courses on statistics, mathematics, and Courses from deeplearning.ai, I'll gradually explore new areas within the AI field. While I don't have a specific roadmap, I'm eager to dive into every subfield of AI.

And conformly, I will implement everything said by Aleksa Gordić, shared in his Medium blog - [[3months program].](https://gordicaleksa.medium.com/get-started-with-ai-and-machine-learning-in-3-months-5236d5e0f230)
